# Hangman
Hangman is our implementation of the classic guessing game where you try to figure out the word/phrase by suggesting letters within a certain limited number of guesses. I built this along with my friend Sanit Gupta back when we were in high school. Though the game was part of the term project for the computer programming course, we decided to have fun with it and added a whole story element to it. Making these graphics in C++ was a huge challenge but was definitely worth it. Nudity warning: In our variant of hangman, you lose a piece of clothing with each incorrect guess.
